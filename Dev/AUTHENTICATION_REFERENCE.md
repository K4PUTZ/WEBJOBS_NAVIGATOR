# Authentication System Technical Reference

## 🔐 OAuth 2.0 Implementation

### Current Setup Status
- ✅ OAuth credentials configured by user
- ✅ Web application flow implemented
- ✅ Session-based token storage
- ✅ Multi-user support architecture

### Authentication Flow

```
1. User visits: https://www.mateusribeiro.com/jobs_navigator/
2. Click "Connect with Google" → auth.php
3. Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
4. User grants permissions
5. Google redirects to: callback.php?code=...
6. callback.php exchanges code for access_token
7. Token stored in PHP session
8. User redirected back to main app
```

### Multi-User Support

**✅ WILL WORK FOR OTHER USERS** because:

1. **Session Isolation**: Each user gets their own PHP session
   - Sessions are stored per browser/user
   - No shared token storage between users

2. **Individual OAuth Flow**: Each user goes through their own OAuth
   - Personal Google account authentication
   - Individual consent and permissions
   - Separate access tokens

3. **No User Database Required**: System is stateless
   - No user registration needed
   - No persistent user storage
   - Works immediately for any Google account

### Session Management

```php
// Each user session stores:
$_SESSION['google_token'] = [
    'access_token' => '...',
    'refresh_token' => '...',
    'expires_in' => 3600,
    'token_type' => 'Bearer'
];
$_SESSION['email'] = 'user@example.com';
```

### API Authentication Check

```javascript
// Frontend checks authentication status
fetch('/api.php?action=status')
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    if (data.connected) {
        // User is authenticated - show main interface
        showAuthenticatedApp(data.email);
    } else {
        // User needs to login - show connect button
        showConnectButton();
    }
});
```

### Google Drive API Access

Once authenticated, each user can:
- ✅ Access their own Google Drive
- ✅ Search their own folders
- ✅ Resolve SKU paths in their Drive
- ✅ Use personal favorites/bookmarks

### Security Features

1. **Token Refresh**: Automatic token renewal
2. **Session Timeout**: Configurable session expiration
3. **Scope Limitation**: Only requested Drive permissions
4. **HTTPS Only**: Secure credential transmission

### Testing Multi-User Access

To verify multi-user support:

1. **User A**: Authenticate and use the app
2. **User B**: Open app in different browser/incognito
3. **Expected**: User B sees "Connect with Google" button
4. **Expected**: After User B connects, both users work independently

### Configuration Files

- `credentials.json`: OAuth client credentials (shared for all users)
- `config.php`: Session and OAuth configuration
- `callback.php`: Handles OAuth responses for any user

## ✅ Conclusion

**YES, IT WILL WORK FOR OTHER USERS** without any additional configuration. The system is designed for multi-tenant usage where:

- Each user authenticates with their own Google account
- Sessions are isolated per browser/user
- No user registration or database required
- Immediate access after Google OAuth consent

---
**Security Note**: Each user only accesses their own Google Drive data. No cross-user data access possible.
